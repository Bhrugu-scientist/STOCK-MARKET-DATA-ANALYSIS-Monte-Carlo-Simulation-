# STOCK-MARKET-DATA-ANALYSIS-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-

(1) Collected the stock market data (GOOGLE, APPLE, MICROSOFT, AMAZON) and used PANDAS to get the stock information, used visualiztion libraries such as MATPLOTLIB & SEABORN to visualize the different aspects of it.

(2) Used some methods to analyze the risk of stock based on its previous performance history.
